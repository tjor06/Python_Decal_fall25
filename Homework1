# Answer the following questions as comments below your variables.
# 1. How many different data types did you find? 9 different datatypes
# 2. List all the data types you found. int, float, complex, list, str, NoneType, bool, tuple, dict
# 3. What variables have the same data types? (b and m), (l and d), (k, h, and e)
# 4. What was the data type of l? Why is it not an integer? What does str() do? l is a string, and is not an integer because the code called str(14), which prints the string version of 14
# 5. Look up one more data type not given above. Repeat the same procedure
